# Changelog

## Week 35

### [Add info about how IP address is determined for IP Restriction plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6046) (2023-08-31)

Added a blurb about how the IP Address is determined when using the IP Restriction plugin, as this was confusing customers who were unaware of the appropriate settings that needed to be tweaked for their environment so the IP could be determined accurately.

### [Added info about limiting by IP address](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6045) (2023-08-31)

We were missing details about how the IP address was determined when customers want to limit by IP address. Added these details to clarify how this works and linked to other sources for the appropriate properties that need to be set.

### [Updated RLA index page to share some details from RL plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6044) (2023-08-31)

There were some missing details from the RL (Rate Limiting) plugin which I pasted into the RLA (Rate Limiting Advanced) plugin index page, including extra details about the strategies that can be used and the use-cases for each.

Also added a section for how the IP address is determined as this was missing from the details and was not obvious to customers how this worked when limiting by IP address.

### [feat(pre-built-reports): added changelog entry and an intro sentence](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6009) (2023-08-28)

What did you change and why?

Added a changelog item to release our pre-built reports feature ([Aha ticket](https://konghq.aha.io/features/KP-204)) and an intro sentence into the Analytics section inside the Konnect intro chapter. This feature is rather small and is only for new organization. Therefore, I think we don't need a lot of docs changes.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QnwrHOjR-K-H5w9FQAWltNvq_H0OF8vv-y19o-5CtD0/edit#gid=0) is a list of the pre-built reports we deploy for all new organizations.

### [chore: Sunset Kong Gateway versions 2.1.x-2.5.x](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5992) (2023-08-29)

As of August 24th, 2023, Kong Gateway OSS and Enterprise versions 2.1.x-2.5.x [end their sunset support](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/support-policy/#older-versions).

This PR removes all of the old versions from the docs site, as well as the `/archive` folder maintained on the `main` branch.
We no longer need that folder, since we have a legacy-gateway site.

You can find all of the archived versions at the following links:
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/enterprise/2.5.x/
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/gateway-oss/2.5.x/
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/getting-started-guide/2.5.x/overview/

For the additions to the archive, see https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5993.

https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3347

---

Some specifics:
* Deleting everything to do with `enterprise`, `gateway-oss`, and `getting-started-guide` editions and URLs. All three of those editions were replaced with one `gateway` edition in 2.6.x. Since we're archiving everything before 2.6.x, we no longer need to maintain all of the exceptions for the old editions.
* Plugins: We will no longer build versions 2.5.x or earlier. There wasn't a lot of 2.5.x or earlier content that was unique, so I think that should be fine.
  * If we want to move the old plugin docs to the archive site, we will need to port the whole new plugin hub over there. I'm not sure that it's worth it yet.
